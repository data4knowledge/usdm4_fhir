      rationale for the estimand attributes not described elsewhere in the document.
      This should include a rationale that the selected endpoint(s) are clinically
      relevant and provide a reliable and valid measurement of the intended intervention
      effect. It should also include a rationale for the selected strategies for handling
      intercurrent events.

      text: A description of the rationale for selection of trial population describing
        how the selected population can meet the trial objectives and how the enrollment
        criteria reflect the targeted populations.
    guidance: 'Describe the population selected (e.g., healthy participants, adult
      participants, paediatric participants, pregnant participants, or breastfeeding
      participants) and how the enrollment criteria reflect the populations that are
      likely to use the drug if approved. Specify the population age range (e.g.,
      ≤3 months, ≥18 to ≤80 years old) including the time point at which qualification
      for age criteria is determined (e.g., at time of screening vs randomisation
      for paediatric trials). Specify any key diagnostic criteria for the population
      (e.g., “acute lung injury”, or a specific biomarker profile). If applicable,
      describe similar conditions or diseases and their differential diagnosis.

      Provide a rationale for the trial population ensuring that the population selected
      is well defined and clinically recognisable. Describe how the selected population
      can meet the trial objectives and how the enrollment criteria reflect the population
      of interest.

      If the population targeted by a clinical question is based on a subset of the
      entire trial population, e.g., defined by a particular characteristic measured
      at baseline (e.g., a specific biomarker), this subset should be justified in
      this section.

      Justify whether the trial intervention is to be evaluated in paediatric participants,
      in adults unable to consent for themselves, other vulnerable participant populations,
      or those that may respond to the trial intervention differently (e.g., elderly,
      hepatic or renally impaired, or immunocompromised participants).'

      text: A description of the statistical adjustments needed to limit the probability
        of false positive findings in trials where there are multiple simultaneous
        hypotheses.
    guidance: 'Multiple testing procedures may be needed to limit the probability
      of false positive findings in a trial. Reasons for carrying out multiple statistical
      tests include - but are not restricted to - multiple endpoints, multiple treatment
      groups, multiple hypotheses, subgroups, multiple timepoints.

      Describe any approaches to multiplicity control for the trial. This description
      might go beyond the analysis of primary objectives.

      Specify the statistical approach to control the overall type I error rate as
      well as the (adjusted) significance levels to test specific hypotheses, as applicable.
      Clarify whether the tests/confidence intervals are one- or two-sided.

      State the circumstances under which a trial will be considered to have met its
      primary objective(s). For example, in a study with two primary efficacy endpoints,
      this section should state whether the study would be expected to provide statistical
      evidence on at least one or on both of the endpoints in order to confirm the
      efficacy of the treatment.

      For some statistical approaches it might be helpful to include a graphical depiction,
      as visualisation will be helpful for understanding, coupled with the clinical
      translation of the mathematical choices.

      Details regarding interim analyses should be provided in Section 10.9 Interim
      Analyses.'
