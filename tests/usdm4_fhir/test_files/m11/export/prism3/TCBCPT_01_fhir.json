Trial teams are advised to adopt the template language of \u201cVisit\u201d or \u201cProcedure\u201d to ensure intentional flexibility.  </li><li>For complex trials, assessments that are specific to a sub-protocol should be outlined in a separate SoA in the applicable sub-protocol. Assessments common to all populations/interventions should remain in the master protocol.</li></ul><p>&lt;Start of example text&gt;</p><table class=\"raw-docx-table\"><tr><td

This includes any tests that are used for eligibility, participant randomization or stratification, or decisions on trial intervention discontinuation. A tabular format is recommended.</p><p>When applicable for studies with extensive sampling (eg, serial PK sampling) a separate table may be added.</p><p>General information:</p><ul><li>Ensure that only essential data are collected. The schedule of activities (SoA) is the primary location for specifying the timing of assessments at each stage of the trial. Do not repeat the SoA schedule in the main text.</li><li>Visit windows may be necessary for data collection. The acceptable windows can be indicated on the SoA by adding \u00b1 days or hours/minutes to the visit day or timepoint row. </li><li>If applicable, specify the order of assessments (eg, performing participant-recorded assessments before other assessments to reduce bias or performing electrocardiograms [ECG] or measuring vital signs before blood draws).</li><li>Notes/footnotes relating to specific procedures should be minimal, brief, and include key information. If additional details are needed, the notes should refer to the section in the protocol main text where details are provided. Note that Day 0 should not be used as a timepoint. </li><li>Combine assessments on consecutive weeks if they are identical and consider separate tables for separate periods of the trial (eg, screening, intervention days, and follow-up). For a multiple-part trial, one SoA table for each part of the trial is recommended.</li><li>An example of a SoA table is included. Modify as required.</li><li>Protocol language in the SoA section should be kept general and should describe the location of procedures or visits in a non-specific way.  In order to facilitate the unanticipated use of a local laboratory/imaging, a home health care nurse, or a participant visit to a family doctor, it is recommended that location information is not specified in the SoA or footnote sections.  For instance, specifying the procedure location description in the SoA as \u201cOn-site visit\u201d or \u201cOn-site laboratory/ imaging\u201d, creates unnecessary protocol deviations if on-site visits cannot be conducted. Trial teams are advised to adopt the template language of \u201cVisit\u201d or \u201cProcedure\u201d to ensure intentional flexibility.  </li><li>For complex trials, assessments that are specific to a sub-protocol should be outlined in a separate SoA in the applicable sub-protocol.

For considerations on estimands, refer to ICH E9(R1). Ensure alignment with every other section of the protocol.</p><p>Include additional level 3 headings (eg, add a new level 3 heading for each secondary objective as needed). If there is more than one objective in a category (eg, more than one secondary objective), number each objective consecutively as the level 3 heading (eg, Secondary Objective 1, Secondary Objective 2, etc).</p><p>Objectives:</p><ul><li>Objectives and endpoints for specific therapeutic areas may be accessed in the therapeutic area libraries. List each scientific objective of the trial, clearly and concisely. The objectives should present the questions that the trial is designed to answer (which can include predefined safety parameters). Secondary objectives should not merely reiterate the secondary endpoints of the trial.</li><li>State specific PRO objectives. Specify the PRO concepts/domains used to evaluate the intervention (eg, overall health-related quality of life, specific domain, specific symptom) and, for each one, the analysis metric (eg, change from baseline, final value, time to event) and the principal timepoint or period of interest.</li><li>The objectives should be stated with sufficient specificity that the reader can easily understand the intended context (eg, Superiority of [intervention X] vs control when the intervention is taken as directed). Consultation or review by a statistician is recommended.</li></ul><p>Endpoints:</p><ul><li>An endpoint is defined as a \u201csubject-level attribute of interest\u201d, so ensure wordings like \u201cproportion of participants reaching [target]\u201d are not used, but rather \u201cParticipant reaching [target] (yes/no)\u201d when defining endpoints.</li><li>Ensure that there is an endpoint with associated timepoint or timeframe for each trial objective, and that there are no endpoints without a corresponding objective.</li><li>Be specific and selective when choosing and describing primary and secondary endpoints because results for all primary and secondary endpoints are required to be listed on the ClinicalTrials.gov website and other public registers.</li><li>In a trial designed to establish efficacy, a primary endpoint should measure a clinically meaningful therapeutic effect or be a surrogate or other endpoint with a demonstrated ability to predict clinical benefit.</li><li>Avoid vague descriptions of primary and secondary endpoints that encapsulate a large number of measures and timepoints, such as \u201csafety and tolerability as determined by AE reporting, laboratory values, vital signs, and ECGs.\u201d In a typical clinical trial this could equate to hundreds of endpoints, all of which must be registered on ClinicalTrials.gov and other public registers. Consider including such general objectives and endpoints in the Exploratory section, which are not required on public registers.</li><li>If there is a safety measure of special relevance, this can be included as a specific primary or secondary endpoint (eg, a specific lab measurement or an adverse event of special interest).</li><li>It is recommended not to include trial procedures as an endpoint; only the data resulting from the procedure should be an endpoint. For example, abnormal physical examination should not be designated as an endpoint unless it is clear where this endpoint is captured and how it will be summarized in the clinical study report. Details of procedures should be placed in Section 8 Trial Assessments and Procedures. Consider whether the desired endpoints will be achievable in case of unexpected findings, technical/equipment issues, or personnel failure.</li><li>If a clinical outcome assessment (COA) is included in the trial, mention the concept being measured (eg, fatigue) as well as the instrument (eg, fatigue as measured by the fatigue scale in the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Anemia [FACT-An]). Avoid the term quality of life and use a more specific term such as physical functioning or vitality.</li><li>If additional exploratory endpoints (eg, pharmacodynamic endpoints) may be explored, consider addition of a general statement giving an indication of the types of endpoints that might be explored. For example, in cardiovascular studies, a statement such as \u201cAdditional atherosclerotic biomarkers may be explored\u201d may be appropriate. The trial procedures section of the protocol should clarify, to the extent possible, how and when the additional endpoints will be selected, the types of endpoints that may be assayed (eg, protein, messenger ribonucleic acid), whether existing or additional samples would be used for these assays, and how any changes to exploratory endpoints will be documented.</li><li>Identify surrogate markers if used as trial endpoints.</li></ul><p>Estimands:</p><ul><li>Estimands include 5 attributes: the treatment condition of interest, the population, variable (or endpoint), details of how to account for intercurrent events (ICEs), and the population-level summary for the variable.</li><li>The ICH E9(R1) addendum tries to distinguish the development of the estimand, ie, the treatment effect of interest, and the conduct of a trial for estimation. While in practice the estimand is defined in order to plan a trial, ideally it should be possible to communicate the estimand without reference to trial-specific context. For example, the population should reflect the set of patients or individuals targeted by the clinical question, represented by the trial population. Describing the population, the appropriate term \u201cpatients\u201d or \u201cindividuals\u201d should be used instead of referring to trial participants. The same is true for the treatment conditions: the test intervention and the control to which comparison(s) will be made should be mentioned, giving the name of the specific intervention, but not simply referring to \u201ctrial\u201d intervention.</li><li>The estimands should be clear and include sufficient detail on each attribute.</li><li>Define one or more estimands for the primary and secondary objectives. An estimand description is not required for exploratory objectives.</li><li>If including more than one estimand for the primary objective, it should be specified which one(s) is/are primary/co-primary/multiple primary/supplementary. If for a particular trial different primary estimands/endpoints are required for different regulatory authorities, it should be specified which one is considered primary for each regulatory authority.</li></ul><p>For complex trials using a master protocol, the master protocol should have an overarching scientific hypothesis and the primary objective should not be changed during the conduct of the trial.</p><p>No text is intended here (heading only).</p></div>"

Participants may be asked to complete a survey, at one or more time points, to collect feedback on their experience with participation in the clinical trial. Individual participant level responses will be anonymous to the investigator and site staff and so will not be reviewed by investigators. Coded responses would be used by the sponsor to understand where improvements can be made in the clinical trial process. We may combine responses across trials and with data collected as part of the trial, such as demographics, to investigate correlations with the participant experience. We may share aggregated data, maintaining individuals\u2019 anonymity, with site staff so they can take steps to understand and improve the participant experience at their site. This questionnaire does not collect data about the participant\u2019s disease, symptoms, treatment effect or adverse events and therefore would not be trial data. Consequently, this data does not contribute to any endpoints on the trial and will be analyzed and reported separately from the clinical trial data. The results of this participant experience analysis may be published or presented at scientific meetings, with the Sponsor complying with the requirements for publication. Should any spontaneous information be collected about AEs, this would be reported and transferred to the safety database.</p><p>&lt;End of example text&gt;</p></div>"

Determination of risk for a marketed compound should also consider the risks outlined in the product label. Further guidance can be found in International Council for Harmonization [ICH] Guideline M3(R2) and Clinical Trial Coordination Group (CTCG).

In this case, all participant identifiers, with the exception of the participant number, will be redacted on the copies of the medical records before submission to [X].</li><li>The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, and/or other clinical information. Whenever possible, the diagnosis (not the individual signs/symptoms) will be documented as the AE/SAE.</li><li>For device deficiencies, it is very important that the investigator describes any corrective or remedial actions taken to prevent recurrence of the deficiency.</li><li><ul><li>A remedial action is any action other than routine maintenance or servicing of a medical device where such action is necessary to prevent recurrence of a device deficiency.

Reasons for carrying out multiple statistical tests include - but are not restricted to - multiple endpoints, multiple treatment groups, multiple hypotheses, subgroups, and multiple timepoints.</p><p>In case of more than one primary estimand due to different requirements across different regulatory agencies, specify which estimands are required by which authorities if this is not clear from Section 3. </p><p>Describe any approaches to multiplicity control for the trial. This description might go beyond the analysis of primary objectives.</p><p>Specify the statistical approach to control the overall type I error rate as well as the (adjusted) significance levels to test specific hypotheses, as applicable. Clarify whether the tests/confidence intervals are one- or two-sided.</p><p>State the circumstances under which a trial will be considered to have met its primary objective(s). For example, in a trial with two primary efficacy endpoints/estimands, this section should state whether the trial would be expected to provide statistical evidence on at least one or on both of the endpoints/estimands in order to confirm the efficacy of the treatment.</p><p>For some statistical approaches it might be helpful to include a graphical depiction, as visualisation will be helpful for understanding, coupled with the clinical translation of the mathematical choices.</p><p>Details regarding Interim Analyses should be provided in Section 10.9 Interim Analyses.</p><p>&lt;Start of example text&gt;</p><p>Example 1:</p><p>The primary objective is to demonstrate that [test intervention] is superior to [control] in achieving [outcome] at [timepoint]. Thus, the null hypothesis to be tested in relation to the primary estimand is as follows:</p><ul><li>Null hypothesis: [test intervention] is not different from [control] with respect to the achievement of [outcome] at [timepoint].</li></ul><p>vs. </p><ul><li>Alternative hypothesis: [test intervention] is different from [control] with respect to the achievement of [outcome] at [timepoint].</li></ul><p>The null and alternative hypotheses corresponding to the secondary estimands are as follows:</p><p>Secondary objective [1]:</p><ul><li>Null hypothesis: [test intervention] is not different from [control] with respect to the achievement of [outcome/endpoint] at [timepoint].</li><li>Alternative hypothesis: [test intervention] is different from [control] with respect to the achievement of [outcome] at [timepoint].</li></ul><p>Secondary objective [2]:</p><ul><li>Null hypothesis: [test intervention] is not different from [control] with respect to change from baseline to [timepoint] in [health measurement/outcome].</li><li>Alternative hypothesis: [test intervention] is different from [control] with respect to change from baseline to [timepoint] in [health measurement/outcome].</li></ul><p>A closed testing procedure that controls the family-wise error rate in the strong sense at the overall [5]% level will be applied. The statistical comparisons for the primary efficacy endpoint and the key secondary endpoints will be carried out in the hierarchical order as indicated in Section 10.1. This means that the statistical hypotheses are tested in the prespecified order at the same significance level of \u03b1\u00a0=\u00a0[0.05] as long as all preceding hypotheses are rejected. Once a hypothesis is not rejected, subsequent hypotheses cannot be formally tested and therefore cannot be rejected.</p><p>Example 2:</p><p>For the primary estimand with primary endpoint, change from baseline to [timepoint] in [health measurement or observation]<sub>, </sub>the following 2 (confirmatory) 1-sided hypotheses are planned to be tested for [test intervention] versus [control]. Let the mean treatment difference be defined as \u03bc = ([test intervention] minus [control]). Note that smaller values for [endpoint] are better.</p><p>The primary aim is to show that the [test intervention] is not unacceptably worse than the existing [control], using a non-inferiority margin of [non-inferiority margin] [unit] for the difference of the means. If this is confirmed, a test for superiority will subsequently be made. </p><p>Noninferiority (noninferiority margin is [noninferiority margin])</p><p>H0: \u03bc \u2265 [noninferiority margin] against Ha: \u03bc &lt; [noninferiority margin]</p><p>Superiority</p><p>H0: \u03bc \u2265 0.0 [unit] against Ha: \u03bc &lt; 0.0 [unit]</p><p>Operationally the hypotheses will be evaluated by 2-sided tests.</p><p>&lt;End of example text&gt;</p><p>The type I error of \u03b1= [5]% will be controlled in the strong sense using a hierarchical (fixed sequence) testing procedure. This is based on priority ordering of the null hypotheses and testing them in this order using the [2]-sided [95]% confidence interval approach until an insignificant result appears. Consequently, the second null hypothesis will only be tested if the first null hypothesis has been rejected in favor of [test intervention]. Operationally the hypotheses will be evaluated by 2-sided tests.</p><p>The steps in the hierarchical testing procedure are as follows:</p><p>Step 1: [health measurement or observation] noninferiority of [test intervention] versus [control]</p><p>Step 2: [health measurement or observation] superiority of [test intervention] versus [control]</p><p>Example 3</p><p>The objective is to demonstrate bioequivalence of a single administration of [formulation X] relative to a single administration of [formulation Y] with respect to the rate and extent of absorption of [drug] as measured by Cmax and AUC0-\u221e in healthy adults. This implies that the 90% confidence interval for the estimated ratio of geometric means (formulation X/formulation Y) lies within the standard bioequivalence limits of 0.80-1.25 for both Cmax and AUC0-\u221e for the trial to be successful.
